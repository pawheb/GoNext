## Vision and Scope

##### Vision statement

<!--The app is designed to be minimalistic and user-friendly, allowing easy task management and progress tracking. Users can set schedules, monitor completion percentages, and maintain streaks for consistent habits. The app rewards task and habit completions with badges.-->
<!-- The goal of this project is to create an app that will help them remember their resolutions, habits and budgeting goals. It will be an easy way of keeping track of your achievements providing a sense of acomplishement with every finished task. Visualizing your spending will also help with sticking to your saving goals and enable you to track your expenses. We want to help others and ourselves stick to our goals and live the best life we can. -->
The purpose of the project is to create a mobile application that manages the prioretary list of user tasks and tasks of groups to which the user belongs.

## Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a set of criteria that must be performed for a particular User Story to be considered “done”.

1. All tasks completed
2. US is accepted by the client  
3. The code merged into the main branch

## Risk Plan

##### Success Threshold 

<!---
The project fails if:
 Essential features such as habit tracking, visual progress insights, task and habit management, reminders, and goal setting are incomplete or not functioning as intended.
Users find it difficult to navigate the app or encounter usability issues, leading to dissatisfaction and disengagement.
Reminders are unreliable, causing users to miss their tasks and habits frequently.
Milestone tracking for goals is confusing or not visually represented clearly, leading to user frustration.

- The "must" user stories are not developed
- The app is not in a working condition upon release.
The team is not satisfied with the app and their work on the project, based on a questionare at the last meeting before final release. -->

The project is considered to be successful if:
<!--- By the final release date, all essential features, namely habit tracking, task and habit management and reminders, are fully implemented and pass acceptance tests without critical defects.
Users find the app intuitive, user-friendly, and engaging, leading to positive feedback and a high level of satisfaction.
Reminders are delivered accurately and on time, ensuring users can effectively manage their tasks and habits.
Milestone tracking for goals is visually appealing, easy to understand, and provides users with a sense of achievement and progress. -->

- All user stories are completed, including assigned tasks.
- All team members contributed equally to the project.
- The team is satisfied with the application and their work on the project,

<!-- - The interface of the app it appealing to most group members and clients. -->

##### Risk List

<!-- - RSK1 - PxI: 4x5=20; Inaccurate Time and Effort Estimations
  - Risk: The team lacks experience in estimating the time and effort required for tasks, leading to underestimations or overestimations, resulting in unforeseen project delays.
  - Impact: 5
  - Likelihood: 4 -->

##### Actions for risk mitigations (PxI>=20)

<!-- - R1 - Generative IA (LLM) can hallucinate:
    - Action: Provide users knowlegde of the limitations of generative AI and address potential inaccuracies in outputs.
    - Action: Keep the LLM updated with the latest information, secure version and best practices to minimize inaccuracies.
    - Action: Provide the LLM with a structured template that includes accurate user information and other essential details. -->
